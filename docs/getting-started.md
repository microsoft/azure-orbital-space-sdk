# Azure Orbital Space SDK - Getting Started

The Azure Orbital Space SDK aims to provide a seamless developer experience for building, deploying, and managing space applications. By leveraging cloud-native technologies and integrating with Azure services, the SDK simplifies the complexities involved in space application development, allowing developers to focus on innovation and functionality.

## Key Features

- **Integrated Development Environment**: Utilize familiar tools and extensions within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), tailored for space application development.

- **Simulated Testing Environment**: Test your applications on the ground using a [Virtual Test Harness (VTH)](./architecture/virtual-test-harness/virtual-test-harness.md) that simulates the space environment, reducing the need for costly in-orbit testing.

- **Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials**: Access a wide range of [documentation](./table-of-contents.md), [sample projects](../samples), and [tutorials](./quick-starts/quick-starts.md) to get started quickly and learn best practices for space application development.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Configure your development environment on an Azure Virtual Machine, a GitHub Codespace, or even a local Raspberry Pi by following the our [tailored setup guides](./setup/setup.md). This setup ensures you'll have the optimal environment for developing space applications on your platform of choice.

### Access Sample Projects

Explore our [sample projects](../samples/samples.md) to explore the structure and capabilities of the Azure Orbital Space SDK. These projects provide practical examples and best practices, serving as a valuable resource for both new and experienced developers embarking on space application development.

### Develop Your Applications

Start developing your applications using the Azure Orbital Space SDK. Utilize the integrated development environment and tools to streamline your workflow. Harness the capabilities of the SDK to build scalable, resilient, and efficient space applications for your unique missions. <!-- TODO: Link to starter apps -->

### Design Your Own Virtual Test Environment

Leverage the [Azure Orbital Space SDK Virtual Test Harness](../docs/architecture/virtual-test-harness/virtual-test-harness.md) to test your applications under real-world conditions. Use one of our existing [data generators](../docs/architecture/virtual-test-harness/data-generators/data-generators.md) to enhance the fidelity of the simulation environment, or build your own that better aligns to the conditions of your target satellite payload.

<!-- TODO: Should add some documentation here on how to perform a production deployment of a payload application, and any other steps along the journey towards deployment to space -->
