# Deploy the Azure Orbital Space SDK to an nVidia Jetson Nano
The NVIDIA Jetson Nano is a small, powerful computer designed for AI projects at the edge. The Azure Orbital Space SDK can be deployed to an NVIDIA Jetson Nano with GPU-enabled applications to be run within the cluster.

The `deviceQuery` in this README are references to the [nVidia CUDA deviceQuery] (https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery) in the cuda samples repo.  Container images with pre-built copies of deviceQuery and cuda versions are available via
* [ghcr.io/microsoft/azure-orbital-space-sdk/spacesdk-jetson-devicequery:cuda-**11.4**-nightly](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-orbital-space-sdk-core/pkgs/container/azure-orbital-space-sdk%2Fspacesdk-jetson-devicequery) ~300MB

Images with `-dev` suffix have the cuda drivers installed in the image and are intended for testing and validation on the ground.  They are not intended for deployment to production hardware.


## Prerequisite installation and configuration of the Jetson Nano
>Note: this assumes the jetson nano is connected to the internet.  Air-gapped installation of `nvidia-container-runtime` and `cuda-runtime` are beyond the scope of this document
```bash
source /etc/os-release

# Calculate the version and distro name for the keyring download
cuda_distro="${VERSION_ID//./}"
cuda_distro="${ID}${cuda_distro}"

cuda_arch="$(uname -m)"
[[ "${cuda_arch}" == "aarch64" ]] && cuda_arch="arm64"

wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/${cuda_distro}/${cuda_arch}/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt install -y nvidia-container-runtime cuda-runtime-11-4
```

# Validate a GPU-enabled workload in Azure Orbital Space SDK
>Note: The Azure Orbital Space SDK staging requires Docker to be installed.  This step also assumes you have already logged into the Azure Orbital Space SDK repo at https://github.com/microsoft/azure-orbital-space-sdk-setup

1. Clone the repo
	```bash
	git clone git@github.com:microsoft/azure-orbital-space-sdk-setup.git
	cd azure-orbital-space-sdk-setup
	```

1. Build /var/spacedev to include the nvidia plugin and test container
	```bash
	${PWD}/.vscode/copy_to_spacedev.sh
	/var/spacedev/scripts/stage_spacefx.sh --container spacesdk-jetson-devicequery:cuda-11.4-nightly --nvidia-gpu-plugin
	```

1. Deploy the Azure Orbital Space SDK
	```bash
	/var/spacedev/scripts/deploy_spacefx.sh
	```

1. Validate the nvidia GPU has been recognized by k3s
	```bash
	sudo grep nvidia /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/etc/containerd/config.toml
	```

1. Deploy the deviceQuery image tool
	```bash
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nvidia-device-query
      namespace: default
    spec:
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
      runtimeClassName: nvidia
      containers:
      - name: nvidia-device-query
        image: registry.spacefx.local:5000/spacesdk-jetson-devicequery:cuda-11.4-nightly
        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 1
        env:
        - name: NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
          value: all
        - name: NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES
          value: all
    EOF
	```

1. Pod may take a few moments to boot due to image pull and configuration update.  Give it a wait and then pull the logs
	```bash
    spacecowboy@jetson-nano:~$ kubectl wait --for=condition=complete pod/nvidia-device-query --timeout=300s && kubectl logs nvidia-device-query

	```

# Test GPU with deviceQuery in Docker (Optional)
The Jetson Nano GPU workload can be tested using Docker to validate the configuration and drivers are installed for the jetson nano.  Testing in Docker allows quicker iteration and retests by not requiring a full Azure Orbital Space SDK cluster to be deployed every time.  This is intended to be for a ground-based installation.

1. Enable the docker daemon to leverage the GPU through the nvidia-ctk cli
	```bash
	# Configure docker daemon to enable nvidia GPU runtime
	sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
	sudo systemctl restart docker
	```

1. Login and run the deviceQuery nvidia application to test and validate it works
	```bash
	docker run --rm \
       --runtime=nvidia \
       -v /usr/local/cuda-11.4:/usr/local/cuda-11.4 \
       ghcr.io/microsoft/azure-orbital-space-sdk/spacesdk-jetson-devicequery:cuda-11.4-nightly
	```

1. Output will list the device and cuda version running.  You should see the final line `RESULT = PASS` if all is functioning correctly
