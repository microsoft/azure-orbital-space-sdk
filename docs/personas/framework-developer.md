# Framework Developers

A framework developer is any person or entity that actively develops and maintains any component of the Azure Orbital Space SDK. As an example, the Azure Orbital Space SDK team under Azure Space and its individual members would all be considered framework developers. The same would be the case for any individual or group that contributed to any official Azure Orbital Space SDK repository.

Framework application developers maintain the Azure Orbital Space SDK's core, host, and platform services. They also maintain the Azure Orbital Space SDK Virtual Test Harness (VTH). They respond to feature requests and issues, and ensure that documentation is accurate and easy to use. Framework developers also create tutorials and samples that teach others how to use the Azure Orbital Space SDK.
