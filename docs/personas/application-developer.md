# Application Developers

An application developer is any person or entity that contributes to the development of a payload application using the Azure Orbital Space SDK.

Application developers use the Azure Orbital Space SDK client libraries to create their applications. They also use the Azure Orbital Space SDK Virtual Test Harness (VTH) to test their solutions. They may also create their own data generators and develop plugins for the Virtual Test Harness (VTH) to better simulate the on orbit environment their application will be running in virtually.
