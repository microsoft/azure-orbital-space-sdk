# Azure Orbital Space SDK - Sensor Service

The Sensor Service provides access to the wide array of sensors onboard on the spacecraft. This service enables the efficient collection, processing, and distribution of sensor data. Thanks to its highly abstracted and generalized design, the Sensor Service can interface with any type of onboard sensor, whether its an imaging sensor, an altimeter, an accelerometer, or beyond.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Management**: Automates the collection and management of data from multiple sensor types, ensuring efficient handling of large volumes of sensor data.
- **Flexible Data Access**: Enables versatile interaction modes with sensor data, allowing users to submit jobs for asynchronous data retrieval, perform immediate queries for direct responses, or subscribe to sensor data feeds for continuous, passive updates.
- **Data Provision for Further Onboard Processing**: Provides sensor data in standardized formats that facilitates additional processing and analysis, enabling payload applications to apply their own tools to achieve their mission.

## Use Cases

- **Image Capture**: Utilize imaging sensors to capture high-resolution imagery of Earth or celestial bodies, supporting applications in mapping, surveillance, and scientific observation.
- **Data Streaming**: Facilitates continuous data streaming from sensors like accelerometers, magnetometers, and spectrometers, enabling real-time monitoring of satellite health, environmental conditions, and scientific phenomena.
- **Event-Triggered Sampling**: Employs sensors to perform event-triggered sampling, such as capturing atmospheric data when specific conditions are met, enhancing the efficiency of data collection for climate research and disaster management.
- **Remote Sensing Analysis**: Supports remote sensing analysis by providing multispectral and hyperspectral imaging data, aiding in agriculture, forestry, and land use planning.
