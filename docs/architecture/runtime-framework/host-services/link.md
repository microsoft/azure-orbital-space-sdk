# Azure Orbital Space SDK - Link Service (hostsvc-link)

The Link Service facilitates seamless and secure communication links between satellite payloads and ground stations. This service ensures reliable data transmission over space-to-ground and ground-to-space channels, supporting a wide range of mission-critical operations including telemetry data exchange, command and control operations, and payload data downlink. Link service is also the means by which payload applications and runtime services transmit data to one another.

## Key Features

## Use Cases

- **Telemetry Downlink**: Enables the reliable transmission of telemetry data from satellite payloads to ground stations.
- **Payload Data Transmission**: Supports the efficient downlink of payload-generated data, such as Earth observation imagery or scientific measurements, ensuring timely delivery to ground-based processing facilities.
- **Sensor Data Delivery**: Serves as the mechanism by which large sensor data files are made available to payload applications.
