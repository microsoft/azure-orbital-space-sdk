# Azure Orbital Space SDK - Core Service

The core service provides a common code base off which all runtime services and payload applications are built. By leveraging the Azure Orbital Space SDK Core Service for runtime services and payload applications, developers gain significant quality benefits, including enhanced reliability and efficiency. This foundational layer not only streamlines the development process by offering essential scaffolding for message publication and subscription via [Dapr](https://dapr.io) but also ensures that applications are built on a robust, standardized base. This uniformity across services and applications facilitates easier maintenance, scalability, and integration, ultimately leading to higher quality, more reliable space-based applications.

The Core Service is heavily dependant upon the [Setup Service]()...
