# Azure Orbital Space SDK - Registry Service (core-registry)

The Registry service offers an on-orbit container image registry for use with the Azure Orbital Space SDK, leveraging the [Distribution Toolkit](https://github.com/distribution/distribution). This service is designed to facilitate the storage, management, and deployment of container images in on orbit.

## Key Features

- **Secure Storage**: Implements robust security measures to protect container images, including encryption at rest and in transit, along with access controls to ensure that only authorized users can manage and deploy images.
- **High Availability**: Designed for resilience, the Registry service ensures that container images are always accessible, even in the challenging environment of space, supporting the continuous operation of satellite applications.
- **Efficient Distribution**: Optimizes the distribution of container images across on-orbit systems, minimizing bandwidth usage and disk utilization when used in conjunction with the [Build Service]().

## Use Cases

- **Application Deployment**: Supports the deployment of new applications and services on satellite systems, allowing for rapid expansion and adaptation of on-orbit capabilities.
- **Software Updates**: Facilitates the efficient update of existing applications, ensuring that satellite systems benefit from the latest features, performance improvements, and security patches.
