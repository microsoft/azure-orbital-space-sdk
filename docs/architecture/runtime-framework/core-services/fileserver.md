# Azure Orbital Space SDK - Fileserver Service (core-fileserver)

The Fileserver service within the Azure Orbital Space SDK offers a robust SMB (Server Message Block) server designed to streamline file transfers between payload applications and runtime services. This service is pivotal for operations requiring high-volume data exchange or configuration file updates, ensuring seamless and secure data flow across the satellite's onboard systems.

## Key Features

- **Security**: Implements industry-standard encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure data transfers against unauthorized access.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the setup, management, and access of file shares, allowing developers and operators to focus on mission-critical tasks.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Provides comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to empower effective troubleshooting and performance optimization.

## Use Cases

- **Payload Data Handling**: Facilitates the efficient transfer of payload data, such as satellite imagery and sensor outputs, to payload applications for processing and analysis.
- **Configuration Management**: Enables the distribution of configuration files and software updates to payload applications, ensuring that runtime services and applications operate with the latest parameters.
