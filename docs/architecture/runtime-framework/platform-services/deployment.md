# Azure Orbital Space SDK - Deployment Service (platform-deployment)

The Deployment Service is tasked with the deployment, scheduling, and management of payload applications on the spacecraft. This service adapts to the unique hosting architectures and platforms through the use of customizable plugins.

## Overview

To illustrate the Deployment Service's functionality, consider the process of deploying and initiating a payload application by a Satellite Owner Operator from ground control. The sequence diagrams below provide a visual representation of this process, highlighting the critical role of the Deployment Service in managing the lifecycle of payload applications on the spacecraft.

For example, the deployment and initiation of a payload application by a Satellite Owner Operator from ground control is depicted below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant app as MyPayloadApp 
    participant deployment as Deployment Service
    participant ground as Ground Control

    ground     ->> deployment: Uploads schedule file
    deployment ->> deployment: Plugin parses schedule file
    deployment ->> app: Deploys and Starts MyPayloadApp
    app        ->> app: App executes
    deployment ->> app: Stops and Removes MyPayloadApp
```

The Deployment Service exclusively handles the deployment, initiation, and updating of payload applications, ensuring a streamlined and secure process for Satellite Owner Operators. The flow diagram below outlines the process of updating an application on orbit:

    participant app as MyPayloadApp 
    participant deployment as Deployment Service
    participant ground as Ground Control

    ground     ->> deployment: Uploads updated schedule
    deployment ->> deployment: Plugin parses schedule
    deployment ->> app: Patches MyPayloadApp
    app        ->> app: MyPayloadApp executes
```
