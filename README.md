# Azure Orbital Space SDK
The Azure Orbital Space SDK is a solution designed to lower the barriers for developing applications intended to run on spacecraft. The solution was created to be able to run on any spacecraft, providing a secure hosting platform and application kit to create, deploy, and operate applications on-orbit.
As a space partner, you can leverage the Space SDK to offer edge processing on your satellite and provide your customers with the power, approachability, and security of the Microsoft development tools and the Azure ecosystem.
