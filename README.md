# Azure Orbital Space SDK

The Azure Orbital Space SDK is a software development kit, runtime framework, and virtualization platform that makes it easy to develop and deploy applications to space.

As an application developer, the Azure Orbital Space SDK abstracts complex satellite systems and operations into simple components with clear, standardized actions and interfaces. This allows you to focus on what matters - developing the applications you need on orbit.

As a satellite service provider, the Azure Orbital Space SDK provides a lightweight, secure runtime framework that allows your satellites to be treated as a generic compute platform. Through interface standardization satellites become reusable assets that can be modified on orbit to execute different missions through payload applications. Payload applications can be deployed to any of your satellites with zero downtime and no code modifications required.
